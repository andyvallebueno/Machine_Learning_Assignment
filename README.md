# Machine_Learning_Assignment
Final project for Machine Learning course. Prediction of activity quality using data from accelerometers. 

In this assignment, we have fitted a non-linear model to predict the quality of exercise movements using data 
from accelerometers worn by six subjects. The repo includes two documents: 
1. R Markdown file: includes all R code for the compiled HTML file
2. Compiled HTML file: final report
